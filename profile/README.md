# Open Source USACH

## Language support

We highly encourage the use of English for all documentation, but we know it can get really hard adapting to a language you don't natively speak (We've been in the same situation), so you can change this document's language down here.

## What is Open Source USACH?
Open Source USACH (OSUsach) is a community of students from the University of Santiago, Chile and friends collaborating on open-source projects! Even if you are not part of the university, you're more than welcome here to participate and collaborate on our projects.

## Projects

- InternshipBot, easiest way to find software engineering internships.
- [REDACTED], see what others students think about university courses.

## How to contribute

We encourage the use of [Git Conventional Commits](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) in all our repos. If there are multiple people working on the same repo, please use different branches.

If you want to join the organization or you are from the University, you can speak to `Kappaüê∏#1190` on Discord. We'd love to have you here.
